On the state of Software Engineering:

"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build better and bigger idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning." - Rick Cook
 
On Software Design:

If architects designed buildings the way that programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization. [Anon] (observe - "WROTE" - not "designed".)
 
On innovation:

New systems generate new problems. [Anon]

Other Philosophy:

If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. [Edsger Dijkstra]

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. The other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. [C.A.R. Hoare]

Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice is when something works, but you don't know why it works. Programmers combine theory and practice : Nothing works and they don't know why.
 

On recursion, including negative feedback, and a touches of infinite recursion and infinite looping, and maybe some recursive jokes:

There are two kinds of programmers: those who understand recursion, and those who don't understand that there are two kinds of programmers.

There are two kinds of progammers: those who don't understand recursion, and the others.

There are three kinds of programmer: 
    • Those that understand recursion 
    • Those that don't understand recursion 
    • Those that think there are three types of people in this world: 
        • Those that understand recursion 
        • Those that don't understand recursion 
        • Those that think there are three types of people in this world: 
            • Those that understand recursion 
            • Those that don't understand recursion 
            • Those that think there are three types of people in this world: 
                • ...

To understand recursion, you first have to understand recursion.

A programmer went to have a shower, and never came back: because the instructions on the shampoo bottle say "Lather, Rinse, Repeat".
 

A bright young C-coder named Lee 
Wished to loop while i was 3 
But when writing the = 
He forgot its sequel 
And thus looped infinitely.
 

A programmer started to cuss 
Because getting to sleep was a fuss 
As he lay there in bed 
Looping 'round in his head 
was: while(!asleep()) sheep++
 

People:

Someone suggested that a certain software house should have a rhinoceros as their logo - it's thick-skinned, short-sighted, and charges a lot. [Anon]

Q: How many Software Engineers does it take to change a light bulb? 
A: None: it's a hardware problem.

Q: How many Software Engineers does it take to change a light bulb? 
A: But the light bulb works OK on my desktop!

Q: How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? 
A: One: then the house falls down.

Q: How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? 
A: Yes

Q: How many C++ programmers does it take to change a light bulb? 
A: You’re still thinking procedurally. A properly designed light bulb object would inherit a change method from a generic light bulb class, so all you would have to do is call the light-bulb-change() method.

Q: How many Agile devlopers does it take to change a lightbulb? 
A: It's not just the lightbulb – the whole building's wiring needs refactoring.

Q: How many Microsoft decvelopers does it take to change a light bulb? 
A: None, they just make darkness™ a company standard and tell everyone “this behavior is a cool new feature.”

Q: How many Systems Analysts does it take to change a light bulb? 
A: 255 – 128 to observe and define the problem, 64 to refine the concept, 32 to do the feasibility study, 16 to elicit the requirements, 8 to write the specification, 4 to do the detailed design, 2 to normalize the database, and one to write the code. (None to test it, of course.)

Q: How many hardware engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? 
A: None, they work around it in software.

Q: What is the difference between a programmer and a non-programmer? 
A: The non-programmer thinks a kilobyte is 1000 bytes but a programmer is convinced that a kilometre is 1024 metres.

The shortest programmer joke: 
    • "Almost done!"

There are only 2 kinds of SQL developers: 
    • those who know how COUNT() treats NULLs; 
    • those who don't; 
    • those who don't care.
 

Top 10 things likely to be overheard from a Klingon Programmer:

Specifications are for the weak and timid!
You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you stand!
Indentation? I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!
What is this talk of release? Klingons do not release software. Our software escapes leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality assurance people in its wake.
Klingon function calls do not have parameters - they have arguments - and they ALWAYS WIN THEM.
Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak.
A True Klingon Warrior does not comment on his code!
Klingon software does not have BUGS. It has FEATURES, and those features are too sophisticated for a Romulan pig like you to understand.
You cannot truly appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the original Klingon.
Our users will know fear and cower before our software! Ship it! Ship it and let them flee like the dogs they are!

 
Hardware, Operating Systems, parallelism:

Hardware: The part of a computer that you can kick.

Don't anthropomorphize computers. They hate that!

If the box says, "This software requires Windows Vista or better," does that mean it'll run on Linux?

There's no place like /.

Q: Why did the concurrent chicken cross the road? 
A: the side other To to get
 

On number bases:

There are 10 types of programmers: those who understand binary, and those who don't.

Q: 0 is false and 1 is true, right? 
A: 1.

Shakespeare asked "To be, or not to be?" No-one could answer that until we invented programming languages – clearly 2B | ~2B is FF.

Two bytes meet: one greets the other with "how are you today", and the other replies "feeling a bit off".

Q: Why do programmers confuse Haloween and Christmas? 
A: Because Oct 31 = Dec 25...
 

Code:


int smallRandom()
{
    return 4; // chosen by an unbiased dice throw,
              // so MUST be random.
}

Programming Languages:

The C language combines all the power of assembly language with all the ease-of-use of assembly language.

Q: Why doesn't C++ have a garbage collector? 
A: Because there would be nothing left!

In C we had to code our own bugs. In C++ we can inherit them.

Q: Why did the programmer quit his job? 
A: Because he didn't get arrays.

The Nine Types of Computer User (a left-over from the days when "user" still meant someone who'd write at least a bit of progam code – these days such people write a bit of HTML1, which I see this page still mostly is. I seall should drag it into the late '90s sometime.)

El Explicito    "I tried the thing, ya know, and it worked, ya know, but now it doesn't, ya know?"
Advantages: Provides interesting communication challenges.

Disadvantages: So do chimps.

Symptoms: Complete inability to use proper nouns

Real Case: One user walked up to a certain Armenian pod manager and said, "I can't get what I want!" The pod manager leaned back, put his hands on his belt-buckle, and said, "Well, ma'am, you've come to the right place."
 
 

Mad Bomber
    "Well, I hit Alt-f6, shift-f8, Cntrl-f10, f4, and f9, and now it looks all weird."
Advantages: Will try to find own solution to problems.

Disadvantages: User might have translated document to Navajo without meaning to.

Symptoms: More than six stopped jobs in UNIX, a 2:1 code-to-letter ratio in Word

Real Case: One user came in complaining that his Word document was underlined. When I used reveal codes on it, I found that he'd set and unset underline more than fifty times in his document. 
 

Frying Pan/Fire 
Tactician
    "It didn't work with the data set we had, so I fed in my aunt's recipe for key lime pie."
Advantages: Will usually fix error.

Disadvantages: 'Fix' is defined VERY loosely here.

Symptoms: A tendency to delete lines that get errors instead of fixing them.

Real Case: One user complained that their program executed, but didn't do anything. The helpdesk staff looked at it for twenty minutes before realizing that they'd commented out EVERY LINE. The user said, "Well, that was the only way I could get it to compile." 
 

Shaman
    "Last week, when the moon was full, the clouds were thick, and formahaut was above the horizon, I typed f77, and lo, it did compile."
Advantages: Gives insight into primitive mythology.

Disadvantages: Few helpdesk staff are anthropology graduates.

Symptoms: Frequent questions about irrelevant objects.

Real Case: One user complained that all information on one of their disks got erased (as Norton Utilities showed nothing but empty sectors, I suspect nothing had ever been on it). Reasoning that the deleted information went somewhere, they wouldn't shut up until the helpdesk staff checked four different disks for the missing information. 
 

Miracle Worker
    "But it read a file from it yesterday!" 'Sir, at a guess, this disk has been swallowed and regurgitated.' "But I did that a month ago, and it read a file from it yesterday!"
Advantages: Apparently has remarkable luck when you aren't around.

Disadvantages: Complains when helpdesk use the word "incredible".

Symptoms: Loses all ability to do the impossible when you're around. Must be the kryptonite in your pocket.

Real Case: At least three users have claimed that they've loaded PC Files from Macintosh disks.
 

Maestro
    "Well, first I sat down, like this. Then I logged on, like this, and after that, I typed in my password, like this, and after that I edited my file, like this, and after that I went to this line here, like this, and after that..."
Advantages: Willing to show you exactly what they did to get an error.

Disadvantages: For as long as five or six hours.

Symptoms: Selective deafness to the phrases, "Right, right, okay, but what was the ERROR?", and a strong fondness for the phrase, "Well, I'm getting to that."

Real Case: I once had to spend half an hour looking over a user's shoulder while they continuously retrieved a document into itself and denied that they did it (the user was complaining that their document was 87 copies of the same thing).
 

Princess
(unfair, perhaps,
as these tend,
overwhelmingly,
to be males)
 

"I need a Mac, and someone's got the one I like reserved, would you please garrotte him and put him in the paper recycling bin?"
Advantages: Flatters you with their high standards for your service.

Disadvantages: Impresses you with their obliviousness to other people on this planet.

Symptoms: Inability to communicate except by complaining.

Real Case: One asked to remove the message of the day because he (the user) didn't like it.

Haiku

A Japanese Haiku is a poem of 3 lines and 17 syllables: 
   • 5 syllables in the first line 
   • 7 in the second 
   • 5 in the third 
A Haiku expresses a deep insight with brevity, often with a Zen indirectness. English Haiku are now also coming to permit a 3/5/3-syllable pattern.

Haiku seem to be especially suited to expressing the uncertain emotions that many of us are left with, when using computers. In many cases, their obscurity could be less than that of computer-error messages. Here are some such "computer Haiku", loosely classified.

Disaster has struck

Serious error. 
All shortcuts have disappeared. 
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

Program aborting: 
Close all that you have worked on. 
You ask far too much.

Your file was so big. 
It might be very useful. 
But now it is gone.

Three things are certain: 
Death, taxes and lost data. 
Guess which has occurred.

Having been erased, 
The document you're seeking 
Must now be retyped.

With searching comes loss 
And the presence of absence: 
"My Novel" not found.

On the web/on the internet

The Web site you seek 
Cannot be located, but 
Countless more exist.

You step in the stream, 
But the water has moved on. 
This page is not here.

My computer dies. 
I cannot send my e-mail. 
Dare I phone some-one?    [R&C Lester]

Stay the patient course. 
Of little worth is your ire. 
The network is down.

    
Windows

Chaos reigns within. 
Reflect, repent, and reboot. 
Order shall return.

Yesterday it work'd. 
Today it is not working. 
Windows is like that.

Windows NT crash'd. 
I am the Blue Screen of Death. 
No-one hears your screams.

The novice user

"Press any key" 
More than a hundred - 
Which is "any"?                [R&C Lester]

Hardware problems

First snow, then silence. 
This thousand-dollar screen dies 
So beautifully.

The Tao that is seen 
Is not the true Tao – until 
You bring fresh toner.

Out of memory. 
We wish to hold the whole sky, 
But we never will.

Ultimate Truth

A crash reduces 
Your expensive computer 
To a simple stone.

Stories

There were three engineers driving along the motorway in a car – a chemical engineer, an electrical engineer and a software engineer. The engine suddenly dies and they just manage to steer it onto the hard shoulder.

The chemical engineer then says "Oh no, we must have run out of petrol. We’ll have to get someone to stop and syphon some from their car".

"No, no, no" says the electrical engineer "Obviously the battery has gone flat. We’ll have to get someone to stop and use the jump leads to recharge it".

"No, you're both wrong" says the software engineer "clearly the car stopped because we had too many windows open".

[Mark Borrowdale]

Alternative ending:

"Well," says the software engineer "we could just try all getting out, then getting back in again".

[Anon]
 

A surgeon, a lawyer, and a systems analyst were walking home together from Church one Sunday, and somehow they got into competition over the relative seniority of their professions.

"God made Eve from one of Ada's ribs", said the surgeon, "and that was the first operation."

The lawyer replied that "Much earlier, God made order out of chaos - that was the first law."

"Who do you think caused all the chaos?" said the Systems Analyst.

[Anon]
 

Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from here, a king summoned two of his advisors for a test. He showed them both a shiny metal box with two slots in the top, a control knob, and a lever. "What do you think this is?"

One advisor, an engineer, answered first. "It is a toaster," he said. The king asked, "How would you design an embedded computer for it?" The engineer replied, "Using a four-bit micro-controller, I would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantifies its position to one of 16 shades of darkness, from snow white to coal black. The program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16-element table of initial timer values. Then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table. At the end of the time delay, it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast. Come back next week, and I'll show you a working prototype."

The second advisor, a computer scientist, immediately recognized the danger of such short-sighted thinking. He said, "Toasters don't just turn bread into toast, they are also used to warm frozen waffles. What you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker. As the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated, they will demand more capabilities. They will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage, fry bacon, and make scrambled eggs. A toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete. If we don't look to the future, we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years."

"With this in mind, we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem. First, create a class of breakfast foods. Specialize this class into subclasses: grains, pork, and poultry. The specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast, muffins, pancakes, and waffles; pork divided into sausage, links, and bacon; and poultry divided into scrambled eggs, hard- boiled eggs, poached eggs, fried eggs, and various omelet classes." "The ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork, dairy, and poultry classes. Thus, we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance. At run time, the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says, 'Cook yourself.' The semantics of this message depend, of course, on the kind of object, so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs."

"Reviewing the process so far, we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food. In the design phase, we have discovered some derived requirements. Specifically, we need an object-oriented language with multiple inheritance. Of course, users don't want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying, so concurrent processing is required, too.

"We must not forget the user interface. The lever that lowers the food lacks versatility, and the darkness knob is confusing. Users won't buy the product unless it has a user-friendly, graphical interface. When the breakfast cooker is plugged in, users should see a cowboy boot on the screen. Users click on it, and the message 'Booting UNIX v.8.3' appears on the screen. (UNIX 8.3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market.) Users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook." "Having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase, all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase. An Intel Pentium with 48MB of memory, a 1.2GB hard disk, and a SVGA monitor should be sufficient. If you select a multitasking, object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built-in GUI, writing the program will be a snap. (Imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware-first design strategy to lock us into a four-bit micro-controller!)."

The king wisely had the computer scientist beheaded, and they all lived happily ever after.

Poems

C Fever

I must get down to some C again, and let the admin lie, 
And all I ask is my old PC and a mouse to steer her by, 
And the key's click, and the beep's song, and strong coffee making, 
And the grey mist on the screen's face, and grey thoughts breaking.

I must get down to some C again, for the call of the curly bracket 
Is a wild call and a clear call and I know I cannot hack it, 
And all I ask is 'error free' and the cursor flying, 
And no hung prog, and no failed Run, and the C bird's crying.

I must get down to some C again, to the vagrant gyp-C life, 
But -- it's set this now and mark that next, and deadlines cut like a knife, 
And all I ask is a bit more time, 'cos Linking takes for ever, 
And a quiet doze in front of the screen when the last run's over.

[Hugh W Rooms, with apologies to John Masefield: March 1993] 
Old Man Fortran

Old Man Fortran, that Old Man Fortran 
It must do somethin', but don't run nothin' 
That Old Man Fortran, it just keeps rollin' along 

It ain't like Algol, and Basic's rotten 
And programs in them are soon forgotten 
But Old Man Fortran, it just keeps rollin' along 

You and me, we toil and sweat 
SYNTAX ERROR is all we get 
Fix that CALL, change that nought 
You write another DO loop and get ABO-ORT 

I've got weary of C and Cobol 
I'm tired of Pascal, and skeered of Snobol 
But Old Man Fortran, it just keeps rollin' along 

[Music by Jerome Kern, lyrics by Brian Meek]

I belong to Fortran 

(with apologies to Glasgow) 

I belong to Fortran 
Fortran 66 
There's nothing the matter with Fortran 
That a GOTO cannot fix 
I'm only a COMMON old programmer 
As anyone here can see 
But give me a couple of storage dumps 
And Fortran belongs to me 

[Brian Meek]
